Here's a summary of everything that was fixed:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes\n- **Invisible bars** (ranking bars, speed bars, all chart bars): Root cause was GSAP ScrollTrigger not firing when elements were already in viewport or during hydration. Fixed by adding a 2-second `setTimeout` fallback in every chart component that forces `animationProgress=1` if GSAP hasn't triggered. Also widened trigger start from `top 80-85%` to `top 90%`.\n- **Model cards, data table, export buttons**: These were already in the code and rendering correctly — the issue was only the bars.\n\n### Design Overhaul (18 items)\n- **Background**: Added 24px dot grid texture at 3.5% opacity, alternating section backgrounds (`section-alt` with `#0C0C0F`), and a blue-tinted radial glow behind the hero\n- **Glass cards**: Changed from `rgba(24,24,27,0.7)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.03)` with stronger borders (`rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`), top-edge highlight, deep drop shadows, and inner catch light\n- **Bar charts**: Replaced 2-stop with 3-stop metallic gradients using new `QUANT_COLORS_LIGHT` palette, added inner highlight strokes, SVG drop shadow filters, and increased corner rounding (`rx={6}`)\n- **Typography**: Hero bumped to `text-6xl/text-8xl` with dramatic white-to-gray gradient and text glow, subtitle brightened to `zinc-300`, all section headings given left accent bars, monospace on all chart numbers\n\n### Interactivity (5 items)\n- Benchmark grid cards: `hover:scale-[1.02]` + hover tooltips showing retention values\n- Quant ranking bars: Hover state with opacity dimming and retention value display\n- Model cards: 3D tilt already existed, verified working\n- Scatter plot: Color legend added showing all quant levels\n- Sparkline: Already at 120x40 (matching spec)\n\n### Page-Specific (9 items)\n- Homepage: Glass card wrappers on all charts, hero stats with CountUp (5 Models, 8 Quants, 5 Benchmarks, 40+ Data Points), alternating section backgrounds\n- Models page: Glass card wrapper on grouped bars, section dividers between areas, alternating background on quant rankings section\n- Model detail: Glass card wrappers on retention curve and speed chart\n\n### Polish (5 items)\n- Nav: Pill-style active state with `bg-white/[0.08]` and bottom glow\n- Footer: Gradient top border, elevated background, better typography\n- Smooth scroll: `scroll-behavior: smooth` on `html`\n- Build: passes with zero errors; lint: clean\n\n### New files created\n- `src/components/ui/hero-stats.tsx` — Hero stat counters with CountUp animation\n- `QUANT_COLORS_LIGHT` added to `src/lib/constants.ts` — Lighter shade palette for metallic gradients","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"aad382dc-da8e-4867-b8a6-4d51c792ab54","total_cost_usd":5.540950349999998,"usage":{"input_tokens":48,"cache_creation_input_tokens":289845,"cache_read_input_tokens":5108570,"output_tokens":33929,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":289845,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":1748,"outputTokens":2014,"cacheReadInputTokens":209616,"cacheCreationInputTokens":35876,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0776246,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":51,"outputTokens":38752,"cacheReadInputTokens":5276429,"cacheCreationInputTokens":296969,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":5.46332575,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"cf2afe86-0e22-416c-98fc-0c53e22bd70f"}
